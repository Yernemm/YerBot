# YerBot
A Discord bot that I use for stuff and things

For setup, you need a file called "config.json" in the root directory, containing this but filled out:
```json
{
  "token": "",
  "prefix": "",
  "ownerID": "",
  "ownerName": "",
  "logChannelID": "",
  "lfmApiKey": "",
  "lfmSecret": ""
}
```
It makes the thing do the do (∩ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)⊃━☆ﾟ. *
